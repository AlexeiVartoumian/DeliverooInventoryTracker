# DeliverooInventoryTracker

 this project is an in house work tool developed that displays items in a queue like fashion that are on sale on the third-party vendor deliveroo and marks them in and out of stock in in a gamified fashion.
solves the problem of the former process being done with pen and paper with hundreds of items across several pages and diffrenet departments, which is prone to human error as well as not accounting for data persistence i.e if a item was out of stock yesterday a given team member may mark it in stock on the paper log, but may not mark it back in stock on the system only marking items out of stock. this is also a time consuming process./

 
please see code for comments on technical details. This part of the project is primarily the User Interface./
